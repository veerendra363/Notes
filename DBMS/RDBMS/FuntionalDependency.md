# Functional Dependency

A functional dependency in a database refers to the relationship between two sets of attributes, where the values of one set (determinant) uniquely determine the values of another set (dependent).  

FD: X --> Y  

X represents a set of attributes or columns, also known as the determinant.  

--> indicates the functional dependency arrow, which signifies that the set of attributes on the left side determines the set of attributes on the right side.  

Y represents the set of attributes or columns that are determined by the set X, also known as the dependent.

X determines Y (or) Y is functionally dependent on X
