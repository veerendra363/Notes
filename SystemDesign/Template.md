# Framework for System Design

### Step-1: Deciding Requirments
1. Functional - what system do
2. Non-Functional - how well does the system perform - availability, scalability, ..

### Step-2: Capacity Estimation
1. DAU / MAU (daily / monthly active users)
2. ThroughPut - how may requests we get per sec or min or hour..
3. Storage / Memory - what is the amount of storage/memory we would require?
4. Network /Bandwidth - how much data comes in and out

### Step-3: API Design
Here we write functional requirements more technically
1. Endit point
2. Body
3. Response

### Step-4: High Level Design
